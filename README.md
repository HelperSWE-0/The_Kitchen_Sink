## Intro

This list was originally a clone of [StackOverflow - List of Freely Available Programming Books](https://web.archive.org/web/20140606191453/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books/392926) with contributions from Karan Bhangui and George Stocker.

The list was moved to GitHub by Victor Felder for collaborative updating and maintenance. It has grown to become one of [GitHub's most popular repositories](https://octoverse.github.com/).
